Project Structure

1.trainTree.py
2.impFactory.py
3.5fold.py
4.Readme.md

My project is compatible with Python 2.7.
For using one of the datasets it is necessary to fill out the relative field in the read_file() function in trainTree.py.
By launching trainTree.py you will have program.py which supports the execution of 5fold.py. Program.py contains also the printed tree in nested dictionary verison. The TrainTree.py prints the simple tree version of the decision tree.<br \>
The impFactory.py contains the Factory pattern used for the choice of Impurity Function.
